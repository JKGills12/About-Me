        <p>Who is Jennie Khann, you may ask? Well, I am a PNW native, but I still can't get used to the rain we have here. You can say, I'm more of a sunshine and beaches type of person. I enjoy the great outdoors, so being in a place with weather that will allow me to do that just about everyday, would be fantastic! Don't get me wrong, we have beautiful weather here some parts of the year and I sometimes don't mind the four seasons we have, because, it sure is beautiful seeing the transitions in seasons from summer to fall and then the occassional snowfall in the winter. </p>
