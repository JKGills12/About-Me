        <p>Who is Jennie Khann, you may ask? Well, I am a PNW native, but I still can't get used to the rain we have here! You can say, I'm more of a sunshine and beaches type of person. I enjoy the great outdoors, so being in a place with weather that will allow me to be outdoors just about everyday, would be fantastic! Don't get me wrong, we have beautiful weather here some parts of the year and I sometimes don't mind the four seasons we have, because, it sure is beautiful seeing the transitions in seasons from summer to fall and then the occassional snowfall in the winter. During these four seasons, you can find me hiking, biking, paddle boarding, doing photography/videography, or snowboarding. If I'm not outdoors, my choice of indoor activities would be photo/video editing, videogames, learning to play a musical instrument, or watching Netflix.</p>

        <p>Professionally, I currently work in the medical field doing admin work, but I am here today enrolled in the UW Bootcamp to transition into the tech field. I have always been fascinated with tech and believe this is my true calling! With the tech industry booming, now is a great time to join in the industry. I know that I will enjoy my journey transitioning in this field. It may not be easy, but I know that I will be able to overcome any fears and difficulties in order to be successful in the journey! I am ready to learn and grow!</p>
